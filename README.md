# Avoguessr ðŸŒŽ - Codeology Fa23

## ðŸ¥‘ Overview
Automated AI for Geoguessr game. The model is inspired by researchers at Stanford who had implemented the geoguessr AI accurately first as well as the papers in the Google Drive folder. Avoguessr creates an interactive map for the user, runs the game in real time by logging in and starting the game, and guesses the country by giving an output. You can test the model by taking 4 different pictures from different angles and play the game.
